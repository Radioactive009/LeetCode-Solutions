You are given the head_ref of a doubly Linked List and a Key. Your task is to delete all occurrences of the given key if it is present and return the new DLL.

Example1:

Input: 
2<->2<->10<->8<->4<->2<->5<->2
2
Output: 
10<->8<->4<->5
Explanation: 
All Occurences of 2 have been deleted.


class Solution {
    static Node deleteAllOccurOfX(Node head, int x) {
        // code here
       Node curr = head;
       while(curr!=null){
           if(curr.data==x){
               if(curr == head){
                   head = curr.next;
               }
               if(curr.prev!=null){
                   curr.prev.next = curr.next;
               }
               if(curr.next!=null){
                   curr.next.prev = curr.prev;
               }
           }
           curr = curr.next;
       }
       return head;
    }
}
