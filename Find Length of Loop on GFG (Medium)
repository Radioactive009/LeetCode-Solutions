Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.


class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLoop(Node head) {
        // code here
        Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Node curr = head;
        while(curr!=null){
            if(visited.contains(curr)){
                int count = 1;
                Node temp = curr.next;
                while(temp!=curr){
                    count++;
                    temp = temp.next;
                }
                return count;
            }
            visited.add(curr);
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
